The AKC is composed of thousands of art icles that came from applying a series of algorithms that perform an automatic content curation based on a thesaurus of terms. The resulting data set is transformed though a process that extracts the meaning of the different data that comprises a scientific article and is later stored in the form of triples in a knowledge base linked to Linked Open Data.",
        "parrafo2": "This project was developed thanks to the support obtained  from the Shuttleworth Foundation through a Flash Grantee granted in December 2019 to Dr. Arianna Becerril García as well as to REdalyc staff from the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico.",

        "parrafo4": "This portal shows the collection through search engines, a visual representation of the knowledge obtained that operates at the same time as a themed article browser, as well as making the data set available for consultation and download through a SPARQL endpoint."
